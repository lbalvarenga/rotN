# rotN
A ROT Cipher Encoder/Decoder available [here](https://lukeathedev.github.io/rotN/).

## How does it work?

<b>rotN</b> simply rotates characters of a given text by N positions. ROT13 is a special case, since applying the algorithm twice yields the original text. You can find more information about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13).

## Is it useful?

Although very insecure, the ROT series of ciphers are great at masking text. An example would be hiding spoiler text or pretending to be cool at school.
