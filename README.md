# rotN
A ROT Cipher Encoder/Decoder available [here](https://lukeathedev.github.io/rotN/).

## How does it work?

<b>rotN</b> simply rotates characters of a given text by N positions. A special case of N would be 13, since rotating it twice will yield the original text, as seen below:

## Is it useful?

Although very insecure, the ROT series of ciphers are great at masking text. An example would be hiding spoiler text or pretending to be cool at school.
